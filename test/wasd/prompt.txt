this is my current HTML Code : 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>KSP - WASD Controller</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container"></div>
    <script></script>
</body>
</html>
```

please make this code so that i can control it using WASD 
1. create the component that will move when WASD is pressed
2. make the component have unique ID or class
3. get the component from querySelector and make it move according to WASD
4. create the controller that will do the WASD logic.
