this is my current HTML code : 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>KSP - 2048</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container-2048"></div>
    <script></script>
</body>
</html>
```

please help me make this code so that it will become a 2048 game properly in HTML
1. create a 4x4 grid, make it each with div and it is placed like 
```
[] [] [] [] 
[] [] [] [] 
[] [] [] [] 
[] [] [] [] 
```
that each have a grey color

2. make a 4 action button for up,down,left,right
3. make it so that everytime an action button is pressed 2 number is spawned, the number spawned can be 2,4,8,16, up to 128, but in the current board needs to have the 2 level above, except 2, example : if 4 wants to spawn then in the board 16 should've been made/ exists in the board, if 32 wants to spawn then 128 should be on the board.
4. make each action button work, if i press the UP then it will move each of the button to the top and also make it stack and able to merge. make it like a proper 2048 game.
5. make sure each component have CSS so it is visible when the game is being played.
6. make sure that the game is proper and works.
7. make sure that there is a lose condition
